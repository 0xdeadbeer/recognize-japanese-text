# Recognize Japanese Text

The script will ask the user to take a screenshot, after that it will save it to some default location, use a tool to extract the japanese text out of the image and automatically copy it to the user's clipboard.

> <b>Note:</b> the script is coded specifically to recognize vertical japanese text and not horizontal.
